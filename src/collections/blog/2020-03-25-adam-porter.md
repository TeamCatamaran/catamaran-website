Anne Parmer: How did you become an entrepreneur?



Adam Porter: My partner inSt@rtup, Adam Brackbill, and I saw a need and thought we could meet it. From there, relationships developed which have turned into other ideas and ventures for both of us.



What is your vision for the future of your company? Of your community?



We want anyone in and around Harrisburg that thinks "I have an idea. Now what?" to make their first call to us so that they get to know the community and supportive culture that exists here to bring their idea to reality. For our community, we envision serving other tertiary cities like Harrisburg that have plenty of smart people with good ideas, but may need a place that corrals and builds on those locally available resources.



What has been the biggest challenge to creating a new venture?



Determining where to start and breaking down the bigger goal into smaller, manageable steps is always more daunting than you think it'll be.



What advice would you give to an earlier version of yourself?



Ask more questions. Stick with it. Put everything in your calendar.



Tell me about your biggest surprise or lesson learned as an entrepreneur?



It sounds a bit trite, but every day is a new surprise. Even with a plan, to some degree or another, you're making it up as you go along, so that environment lends itself to new experiences you couldn't have possibly anticipated.



What question did I miss? What else should I know about you?



A friend once asked me, "How do you know what to do?" meaning: without a boss, how do I determine what tasks need to be accomplished each day. That's half the fun! Does the uncharted path leave you feeling uneasy or off kilter at times? Yup. But dealing with today's challenges make you that much better able to handle tomorrow's.
