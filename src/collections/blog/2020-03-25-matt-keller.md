How did you become an entrepreneur?

I have been a PGA Golf Professional for almost 20 years, and over that time I developed a passion for teaching and coaching. The part of my job I enjoy the most is helping people reach their goals regardless of skill level. Whether it’s someone shooting their age, getting the ball in the air the first time, breaking 100 or shooting under par it’s exciting to be involved in the process.

I have been developing my vision of an indoor golf training facility for a few years and made it a reality when York Indoor Golf & Training Center opened in June 2017. I believe in the calculated risk and pursuing my passion to help players of all ability levels reach their goal or just enjoy the entertainment and social value of learning, playing or practicing at York Indoor Golf & Training Center.

What is your vision for the future of your company? Of your community?

My vision is for York Indoor Golf & Training Center to be recognized as the Premier Center for Golf Instruction and Club Fitting. We are setting up partnerships with local courses so we can take our player development programs and continue to train indoors and transition them outside beginning in the spring of 2018.

Junior Golf is an important area and I feel we can help many kids learn how to play and help juniors dedicated to playing at the high school level and beyond. In the past, golfers would put their clubs away for several months usually around the end of October. The majority of talented juniors, in whatever sport or activity they choose to participate, work on their skill year round. Now, the off season should be the time where players really improve! We can train players physically and mentally reach their goals.

What has been the biggest challenge to creating a new venture?

The biggest challenges are time, finances and competition. Those are probably the big three obstacles when investing in a new venture. However, I was not an established presence in the area since we only moved to the York area in April 2016, networking and getting to know everyone in the community is another challenge we are working on!

What advice would you give to an earlier version of yourself?

I have learned and grown a lot over the years. My goals early in my career were different than they are now, but I would encourage myself to keep learning and develop the skills necessary to grow my own business today. Unfortunately, when I was 25 I had no idea I would own my own business several years later.

Tell me about your biggest surprise or lesson learned as an entrepreneur?

Marketing and advertising to my target audience has been challenging. People are skeptical when they first learn about hitting in an indoors environment. We need to educate people so they understand the value of an indoor Golf Training Facility. The technology is extremely accurate and the programs we use accelerates the learning process. Personally, I prefer many practice sessions indoors now so I can see exactly what I did on a good or poor swing. I can check what I did, if I made a positive adjustment or reverted back to a previous movement pattern. Understanding what you do each swing allows you to make lasting adjustments quicker.

What question did I miss? What else should I know about you?

York Indoor Golf & Training Center is located directly behind Royer’s Flowers on Rt. 30 in York. We are accepting new students regardless of skill level. In addition, we encourage people to practice or play 30 golf courses from around the world on our simulators. We offer a unique experience and accommodate leagues, fundraisers, and private events!
