introduction: >-
  NoiseHub allows you to choose any song from your Apple Music or Spotify
  library and post any 20 seconds of that to your network with a message. You
  can listen to your friends’ posts or geolocate them using a feature called
  Jukebox to hear what people around you are listening to. This allows us to
  highlight local, indie artists that you might not hear about otherwise.

## How did you become an entrepreneur?

It's kind of funny. I had a weird start. My dad passed away when I was six so there wasn't a lot of money in the house and I wanted a Mac, an iPod, and other gadgets. I was really into retro video games; that's what I was passionate about at the time, so I would go out to yard sales and buy retro video games; people didn't know what they were worth on eBay or Craigslist. Then I'd sell them to make a profit. I just kept buying and reselling and buying and reselling until I was able to afford a Mac. It was cool because once that I did that with video games, I thought ‘Oh, I can do this with Mac computers’ so I paid $30 for a Power Mac G3, which is an old 1999 Apple desktop. I repeated the same process until I was able to buy a brand new Macbook. From there I started to teach myself programming and I thought ‘Oh, this would be cool to make an app.’ Then when I started to write code for the iPhone I thought ‘Oh my goodness, this is really powerful, being able to write something and then see it run in real time in your hands.’ I thought that was really cool that I could build something and that just got the wheels turning in the back of my head about what I could do. I wasn't very good at coding at the time so I did need a little more help on that end. So, I went to a summer camp at MIT for iOS development and then I started building apps for other people. The most successful one was probably the MySchool app.

## Tell me about the MySchool app.

My high school is called a one-to-world community so every student in the district gets an iPad. This program started the year I started ninth grade. What everybody noticed was that while they gave us an iPad, they didn't have anything that was mobile optimized. The resources were all over the place. You had to log in 20 times in 20 different places and it took a lot of time to do tasks that teachers and students alike just wanted to do quickly. It just made more sense to me to be able to quickly access information. So, two other students and I said to ourselves, ‘why don't we build an app for this?’ So, we went along down that line and built the app. The second year the app was up was pretty crazy. We had 3,700 downloads. To put that in perspective, there are only about 2,000 students at my high school. So, that was pretty cool to have exceeded the student base. Parents were even using it for push notifications. This project was really cool because I was able to actually build something and see it scale to a lot of people in a community. I learned a lot from that.
